# Geophysical modeling with Devito: From Zero-to-Devito
## Transform 22 workshop Tuesday, April 25th, 11:00 â€“ 13:00 UTC): 

* Presented by: Dr. Rhodri Nelson, Department of Earth Science and Engineering, Imperial College London
* Conference information: https://transform.softwareunderground.org/

[Devito](https://www.devitoproject.org/) is a domain specific language (DSL) and compiler for finite difference schemes. This workshop will provide attendees with an introduction to the core elements of the Devito DSL. A breakdown of the agenda is as follows:
* Introduction to the DSL - Expressing PDEs in Devito
* Building wave-propagators
* Full-waveform inversion (FWI) with Devito

## Workshop prerequisites:
* Basic Python programming knowledge (`Numpy` and `Sympy`)
* Basic knowledge of finite differences

For a more interactive experience, the Devito based material can be run live using [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).
- After navigating to the website, click on the `GitHub` tab.
- Under `Enter a GitHub URL or search by organisation or user` enter the following: `devitocodes/transform22`.
- You will then see the various notebooks for today's session.
- After opening a notebook, uncomment the `!pip install devito` located at the top of each notebook and execute it (Note: You may see an error the first time you execute the cell, in this case simply execute the cell again).

Alternatively you can install Devito on your device. See instruction [here](https://www.devitoproject.org/devito/download.html).
